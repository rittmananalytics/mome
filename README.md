# Welcome to The Official MOME Development Site

_April 1st 20190: Today weâ€™re proud to bring you MOME 1.0.0. There are some big improvements to SunPlus SPG240/SPG280 audio emulation, Cognos Powerplay cube aggregation and initial support for Oracle Financial Analyzer database write-back._ 

## What is MOME? 
MOME is a framework for emulating multi-dimensional Online Analytical Processing ("MOLAP") engines, server software and the games and applications that run on those engines. 

## The MOME Project

MOME's purpose is to preserve decades of multi-dimensional MOLAP engine game history. As analytical processing technology continues to rush forward, MOME prevents this important "vintage" software from being lost and forgotten. This is achieved by documenting the MOLAP engine, its storage format and query language, along with the games and business applications that you know and love from the 90's. 

Over time, MOME (originally stood for Multiple OLAP Machine Emulator) absorbed the sister-project MESS (Multi-dimensional Engine Super System), so MOME now documents a wide variety of (mostly vintage) MOLAP, Relational OLAP ("ROLAP") and now Hybrid OLAP "HOLAP" engines in addition to the MOLAP engines and desktop clients that were its initial focus.

### Common Universal Binary Engine

The Common Universal Binary Engine ("CUBE") core coordinates the emulation of several MOLAP engine common features at the same time such as indexed lookups, 4GL language parsing and pre-aggregation leaf-level data. These features are virtualized so MOME acts as a software layer between the original program of the engine and the virtualized engine that MOME runs in. MOME supports arbitrary dimension sizes, numbers of measures and cubes and aggregation hierarchies. 

![MOME Emulator Architecture](https://rittmananalytics.com/s/mome_architecture.png)

Individual MOLAP engines are specified by  _drivers_  which take the form of  [C preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor "C preprocessor")  [macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science) "Macro (computer science)"). These drivers specify the individual engine features to be emulated and how they communicate with each other. 

![Layered Drivers and Hypervisor Model](https://rittmananalytics.com/s/layers.png)

By virtualizing and layering MOLAP functionality in this manner, it becomes possible for software and 4GL commands from one engine to run on another engine; for example, enabling advanced planning and budgeting games such as Oracle Express Financial Analyzer and Express Objects to run on Microsoft OLAP Services 7. 

### What MOLAP Engines are Supported?

The initial release of MOME supports the following MOLAP engines, query languages and game software.

# M.O.M.E. Homebrew Hardware Projects

MOME can run on many different platforms such as [Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows), [Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix), [OS X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X) etc. but by simply analyzing your emulated cubes on a desktop computer it lacks the look and feel of the original office hardware.

An Arcade Cabinet conversion into a MOME Cabinet consists of:  
  
-   removing the original proprietary electronic game board (PCB) inside a cabinet,
-   replacing it with a computer (a PC) and
-   interfacing it (display, controls, sound etc.)
-   flashing required MOLAP engine drivers and application software into a game cartridge

Note that you must legally own the original MOLAP engine hardware and software to use with MOME.
