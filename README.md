# Welcome to The Official MOME Development Site

_01-04-2019: Today weâ€™re proud to bring you MOME 1.0.0. There are some big improvements to SunPlus SPG240/SPG280 audio emulation, Cognos Powerplay cube aggregation and initial support for Oracle Financial Analyzer database write-back_

## What is MOME? 
MOME is a framework for emulating multi-dimensional Online Analytical Processing ("MOLAP") engines, 4GL programming languages and the servers and OLAP applications that ran on those engines.

## The MOME Project

MOME's purpose is to preserve decades of multi-dimensional MOLAP engine and software history. As analytical processing technology continues to rush forward, MOME prevents this important "vintage" technology from being lost and forgotten. This is achieved by documenting the MOLAP engine, its multi-dimensional storage format and 4GL query languages, along with the software and sample databases for those engines such as Microsoft OLAP Services 7.0 AdventureWorks. 

Over time, MOME (originally stood for Multiple OLAP Machine Emulator) absorbed the sister-project MESS (Multi-dimensional Engine Super System), so MOME now documents a wide variety of (mostly vintage) MOLAP, Relational OLAP ("ROLAP") and now Hybrid OLAP "HOLAP" engines in addition to the MOLAP engines and desktop applications that were its initial focus.

### Common Universal Binary Engine

The Common Universal Binary Engine ("CUBE") core coordinates the emulation of several common MOLAP engine features at the same time such as indexed lookups, 4GL language parsing and pre-aggregation of leaf-level data. These features are virtualized so MOME acts as a software layer between the original MOLAP 4GL and MDX language  and the virtualized engine that MOME runs in. MOME supports arbitrary dimension sizes, numbers of measures and aggregation hierarchies.

Individual MOLAP engines are specified by  _drivers_  which take the form of  [C preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor "C preprocessor")  [macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science) "Macro (computer science)"). These drivers specify the individual engine features to be emulated and how they communicate with each other.

By virtualizing and layering MOLAP functionality in this manner it is now possible to run 4GL commands from one engine to run on another; for example, enabling advanced planning and budgeting applications such as Oracle Express Financial Analyzer and Express Objects to run on Microsoft OLAP Services 7. 

### What MOLAP Engines are Supported?

The initial release of MOME supports the following MOLAP engines and server software:

# M.O.M.E. Homebrew Hardware Projects

MOME can run on many different platforms such as [Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows), [Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix), [OS X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X) etc. but by simply analyzing your emulated cubes on a desktop computer it lacks the look and feel of the original office arcade hardware.

![enter image description here](https://rittmananalytics.com/s/retrohardware.png)

An Arcade Cabinet conversion into a MOME Cabinet consists of:  
  
-   removing the original proprietary electronic game board (PCB) inside a cabinet,
-   replacing it with a computer (a PC) and
-   interfacing it (display, controls, sound etc.)
-   flashing required MOLAP engine drivers and application software into a game cartridge
-   connecting it to a printer

Note that you must legally own the original MOLAP engine hardware and applications that you use with MOME.
